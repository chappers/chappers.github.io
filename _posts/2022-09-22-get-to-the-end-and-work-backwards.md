Building software is hard. There are many essays written. One of them being "write once to throw away". This is nice in theory, but we often don't have the leeway or the available time to do everything twice - so is there a better way?

## Draw the Answer First and Work Backwards

Let's face it, often we already know what the answer is before we write a single line of code - if we don't...what code are you writing!

Now you might say - what if the requirements are undecided? Or we need to do discovery?

I think in this instance, we need to take a pragmatic perspective, and specify what _you_ want the answer to look like, and work backwards. Writing software is rarely writing "new" things - we're often using patterns or libraries we are already familiar with and understand the limitations and applications. The most important thing we can do is to fill in the skeleton as much as possible before committing to work so that the coding exercise becomes merely a "code by numbers" type exercise. 

## How (not?) to Multi-Task

There are lot of articles talking about multi-tasking being the evil to a programmer, and I agree - but the truth is what others see from the outside is multi-tasking is actually just really good planning. If at any stage of the development process you know exactly what you're doing and you can effectively context switch it will look like multi-tasking from the outside looking in. 

By having a [mental checklist](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Mental_Checklist) at all parts of the project, and understanding the timings and precisely what needs to happen is the essence of multi-tasking for a programmer's day to day job. Fundamentally it is a way to train us on moving our concentration on what really matters, rather than trying to concentrate on everything at once. 

## Milestones

To know whether or not you're on track its important to set milestones in your mind. This is more important mentally than on a Jira board, as the mental dexterity required often can be for the smallest tasks, not necessarily "feature level" items. Without Milestones and benchmarks we won't know whether we're making "good" progress or "bad" process in all that we do. 

Setting milestones also enable us to ask and answer questions around what is or isn't important.
