**Claims**: If \\(n\\) is coprime with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then \\(n\\) is coprime with \\(ab\\).

Firstly let us define what we mean by coprime. If \\(n\\) and \\(a\\) are coprime, then

$$ gcd(n, a) = 1 $$

Using Euclidean algorithm, we know that if (and only if) the above is true then there must exist integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that

$$ ax + ny = 1 $$

So then to prove the result above, let \\(v\\), \\(w\\), \\(x\\), \\(y\\) be some integer such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
av + nw & = 1 \\\\
bx + ny & = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Multiplying these two equations together yields

$$ vx(ab) + n(avy + bxw + nwy) = 1 $$

Thus there exists an integer linear combination of \\(ab\\) and \\(n\\), so \\(gcd(ab, n) = 1\\) and \\(ab\\) must be coprime with \\(n\\).
