Given the state of COVID-19 and the reality it will stay with us a while:

- Love in the age of COVID; what does it mean for people looking to settle down?
- Moving out and growing up; leaving the nest? or not leaving the nest, coming back to the nest during COVID
- Finding work during COVID and dealing with employment (or lack thereof)
- The inequality of work during COVID, such as increase child-rearing responsibilities coupled with work expectations
