My PhD is almost coming to an end - so it is a good time to reflect on what a PhD takes!

## Getting Started

One of the key items to a PhD is consistency and self-motivation and drive. My key idea at the start of my PhD was to ensure I made a git commit every single day! This could be:

*  Adding notes for a paper I read
*  Editing my own writing
*  Writing code to reimplement algorithms or code for a paper
*  Writing down future plans

Having this as the baseline helped ensure there was always some kind of measureable progress made. Of course amount of work does not equate to sensible output! Some might look at this list and think it is busy work. This approach worked for me to ensure my mind was always active and useful for building good habits.

## Ideas and Failures

Throughout my PhD I had at least 11 ideas which took an average of 3 months to get to the stage of "proceed" or "drop". That is 33+ months of work, where only ~5 of these ideas made it to the final paper. 

You have to be prepared to commit effort to work which doesn't work out. 

That is the nature of research, sometimes your hypothesis doesn't work out, and you have to start again. What I found is many of my earlier ideas got rejected, the later ones were more promising. This reflects the importance that quantity is important to yield quality (see "Art and Fear" by David Bayles). 

As students we often hold too tightly bad ideas, because we don't know better. Churning out many ideas to continually refine our mental models is probably the best way to overcome this. 

## Things I can do better

I'm convinced I'm not cut out for academia - or if I am going into academia, I need to be a lot better at copy-editing. I believe many of the ideas could have been published quicker if my paper writing was just _better_. This could be a facet of just needing to write _more_ papers or something else. 

Maybe that is something I will think about in the future...
