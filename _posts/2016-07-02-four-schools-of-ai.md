I really like this diagram, so I'll keep it here for future reference. This is
one way of thinking about AI approaches.

The layman may often only associate "tangible" things with AI. That is
the bottom two quadrants. This could be the form of self-driving cars
(agents that act optimally), or robots (agents that act like humans).

At the same time we have to consider the "invisible" forces, for example
face recognition software, or photo recognition which classifies faces, or
locations given a set of images. This too is a form of AI that many today take
for granted.
