If I could go back in time and give advice to myself before starting my full time job what would I say?

You see many people will tell you something similar to:

>  What you learn in university is irrelevant to the real world.

And the truth is, they're right. 

But that doesn't mean you should just forget everything and no progress in knowledge. You see to function in the real world is like being an end-user. You don't actually have to do anything except do what you're told; what is placed in front of you. But that doesn't mean reading the manual won't be helpful. Perhaps there are hidden features in the software or hardware. For example, in many Mercedes cars after you have locked your car, you can continue holding down the button on your remote to automatically close all windows and sunroof. This is not something that is "obvious" from using the vehicle, but nevertheless exists.

This is the similar for pursuing knowledge. True, you may not be able to get a pay rise for learning a new programming language, or doing extra statistics courses in your own time, but they will enable you to make more informed decisions and allow you to possess more depth.

So please, just learn for the sake of learning, and have fun. Be curious question everything.
