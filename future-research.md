## Differentiable Tree Models

If we can transfer the tree weights to neural networks; how about we make them more principaled by having entropy as the critiera for splitting. Ideally, entropy (or any other measure) can be calculated via the loss function and would be differentiable.

## VGDL Games

Single game engine to generate many games that are playable by keyboard and mouse. Probably focus on single player games as well as multi-agent games; so that it becomes more interesting and useful.

Longer term, we may want to "port" a full game over to the VGDL and think about how that can be used to make games "fun" (e.g. can we port over a significant part of zelda?)
