Recently conversations have popped up on career advice [here](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1339777933871865857) and the reaction [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25465579).

In general the advice could be summarised as:

- To get a job its quite important to specific learn things deeply, to understand how things fundamentally work
- But once you have the job, its important to to have breadth especially in environments which require problem solving

If we think about data science - it is the art of science and problem solving. Having technical depth generally doesn't help you actually deploy solutions out! Learning a tool well, but not understanding the fundamentals to apply to different contexts or other toolsets will only seek to stunt your career growth.

The reason why this is important over covering specifics is because data science gernally have problems which are not well bounded or described. Without this strong feedback mechanism honing in precisely on what to focus on is really difficult (in the Range book, this is the contrast between sports like tennis and golf, where in golf you can simply practise strokes all day as the parameters are "known" before you play, whilst in tennis, you have an adversarial which is trying to actively undermine you).

Perhaps the way forward would be:

1.  Know your fundamentals very, very well
2.  Choose a couple of areas you have interest in (i.e. more than one!), and grow out you knowledge through being an expert in your tools
3.  Go back to 1).

Being flexible and adaptable is more important in the scenarios where the environment is generally unkind.
