I've worked through various forms of "Agile" and "Scrum" (I still don't know what Scrum is, probably better that I don't), I've come to enjoy one mode the most, and that is working with Kanban style boards with a semi-regular prioritisation (or grooming) to ensure everyone is focussed. 

This way each person can be self-directed, it forces tooling and platforms to move towards "how can we make sure people's lives are easier" rather than chasing the next feature to implement. Using a Kanban board also means that each person is responsible for what they can do and accomplish - if things slip it should be reflected on the board and in prioritisation sessions (or brought up separately with the manager if its serious). 

This only works if you trust people to deliver - things get done when they get done and we generally have a rough "T shirt size" of the item anyway. The focus as a developer is to continuously improve a release-ready application. 

Things get a bit weird in a more research or experimental team though. That's where I need to do a bit more thinking...

<!-- It's like the two worst development processes mashed together.

Kanban or GTFO for me. It's completely nonsensical trying to "fit" work into a given period of time. All the stupid fucking ceremony needed to estimate effort to measure a velocity so that you know what's realistic in a given sprint length. Give me a break.

With Kanban, it's simple:

    Groom the backlog and assign some basic T-shirt sizes so the product folks can weigh effort against value when prioritizing
    Product prioritizes the backlog
    Devs take tickets in the order they're listed
    Completed work that meets the definition of done makes it to Master
    Cut a release off Master whenever you feel like you want to, and deploy it. Could be immediately after a ticket is done, could be after 3 months of merges into Master. Who cares. It's someone else's decision. The only role of the engineering team is to continuously improve a release-ready application, and it's up to the business to decide when and how often they want to release.

Doesn't get simpler than that.
