After applying (and being rejected) from [Georgia Tech Online Masters degree](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/), I
wondered what the options for me actually was. As a sidenote, I met the minimum requiremenets, but of course coming
from a non-computer science background could not of possibly helped. So here are some breakdowns (in AUD) the cost of
various degrees (in no particular order):

- Georgia Tech (Online Masters of Science - Computer Science) ~7,500
- University of Newcastle (Masters of Information Technology) ~17,000
- University of New South Wales (Graduate Certificate in Computer) ~10,000
- Central Queensland University (Graduate Certificate in Information Technology) ~4,500
- Deakin University (Graduate Certificate in Information Technology) ~11,000
- Charles Sturt University (Graduate Certificate in Information Technology) ~10,000
- University of Liverpool (Masters of Science - Software Engineering) ~22,000
- University of Hertfordshire (Masters of Science - Computer Science) ~11,000
- Walden University (Masters of Science - Information Technology) ~32,000
- South New Hampshire University (Masters of Science - Information Technology) ~13,000
- Swinburne University (Graduate Certificate of Information Technology) ~10,000
- Stanford University (Master of Science - Computer Science) ~65,000

There are many more universities which offer degrees and certificates but this provides some indication of what
the fees look like. Georgia Tech is by far the cheapest masters degree I could find, though some of the masters of science
in information technology had looser entry requirements; since they were designed for graduates _not_ from
a computer science background.

## A Degree is a Degree, is a Degree...

So whats my point? You may take a look at that list and say to me:

> Not all universities are equal! At Georgia Tech (insert another university in the list)
> you would surely get access to world class teachers.

And you're totally correct. There is no disputing that. But nevertheless, a degree, is just a degree.
You do it for that certificate to say that you've learned something and you've achieved a particular standard.

I would argue in the 21st century degrees are worth less; it doesn't matter whether you got your degree from
University of New South Wales, or Swinburne University, because at the end of the day you can receive worldclass
courses for free, from many MOOCs.

With that in mind, I will continue to get a degree; and supplement it with the many MOOCs from the top universities
in the world.

So please, as a reminder to you and especially to myself; remember to learn for the sake of learning.
