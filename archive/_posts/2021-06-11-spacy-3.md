Some code vomit for my reference later...
Took a bit of work, but the notes I'll make is:

- one-hot encode your labels!
- I don't like using CLI tools to train models...so here is a way to bring it in for more control.

I've just decided to copy+paste my stackoverflow answer:

If you update and use spaCy 3 - the code above will no longer work. The solution is to migrate with some changes. I've modified the example from [cantdutchthis](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56294824/1992167) accordingly.

Summary of changes:

- use the config to change the architecture. The old default was "bag of words", the new default is "text ensemble" which uses attention. Keep this in mind when tuning the models
- labels now need to be one-hot encoded
- the `add_pipe` interface has changed slightly
- `nlp.update` now requires an `Example` object rather than a tuple of `text`, `annotation`

```py
import spacy
# Add imports for example, as well as textcat config...
from spacy.training import Example
from spacy.pipeline.textcat import single_label_bow_config, single_label_default_config
from thinc.api import Config
import random

# labels should be one-hot encoded
TRAINING_DATA = [
    ["My little kitty is so special", {"KAT0": True}],
    ["Dude, Totally, Yeah, Video Games", {"KAT1": True}],
    ["Should I pay $1,000 for the iPhone X?", {"KAT1": True}],
    ["The iPhone 8 reviews are here", {"KAT1": True}],
    ["Noa is a great cat name.", {"KAT0": True}],
    ["We got a new kitten!", {"KAT0": True}]
]


# bow
# config = Config().from_str(single_label_bow_config)

# textensemble with attention
config = Config().from_str(single_label_default_config)

nlp = spacy.blank("en")
# now uses `add_pipe` instead
category = nlp.add_pipe("textcat", last=True)
category.add_label("KAT0")
category.add_label("KAT1")


# Start the training
nlp.begin_training()

# Loop for 10 iterations
for itn in range(100):
    # Shuffle the training data
    random.shuffle(TRAINING_DATA)
    losses = {}

    # Batch the examples and iterate over them
    for batch in spacy.util.minibatch(TRAINING_DATA, size=4):
        texts = [nlp.make_doc(text) for text, entities in batch]
        annotations = [{"cats": entities} for text, entities in batch]

        # uses an example object rather than text/annotation tuple
        examples = [Example.from_dict(doc, annotation) for doc, annotation in zip(
            texts, annotations
        )]
        nlp.update(examples, losses=losses)
    if itn % 20 == 0:
        print(losses)
```
