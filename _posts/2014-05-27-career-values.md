**Notes on the MOOC "Enhance your career and Employability skills" Week 1** 

Integrity. "Form follows function" - results driven, challenging work. Flexibility with 
respect to tooling (flexibility/innovation over process). Data driven decisions. 
The customer is not always right; sometimes they don't know what they're looking for.
Mass collaboration over individual work. Automate relentlessly. Sense of purpose and results.

## Lifeline

* Positive Emotions: curiosity, hope, gratitude, joy, enthusiasm, pride, generosity  
* Negative Emotions: worry, dread, anger, sorrow, frustration, envy, selfishness

### Peaks

*  New Job  
*  Productivity  

### Troughs

*  Change in management  
*  Lack of acknowledgement/recognition  
*  Opinion and expertise is ignored  

## Test and Learn

"You don't know what you don't know"  

### Crafting Experiments

Currently I have the opportunity to place myself for nomination for the executive team for a local toastmasters club; I really should just see what it is like to be part of a committee.

Try doing tasks using different tools. Try generalising approaches.

### Shifting Experiences

See how I could get a taste for leadership roles. Is it for me?
