**Here are some notes based on a toastmasters session (May 2014) with Ben Reeve from Inform,
there notes are just for my own sake, and maybe helpful for any readers.**

The most important thing when using this framework is to consider what is **your** behaviour. And then,
think about the behavious of **others**. As you will notice, I belong to the "Dominance" category.

In a nutshell, you could describe any person using two attributes:

- Pace (fast or slow)
- Priority (task or relationship)

This would determine whether they are:

<table>
<tr><td></td><td><b>Task</b></td><td><b>Relationship</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Fast</b></td><td> Dominance</td><td> Influence</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Slow</b></td><td> Conscientiousness</td><td> Steadiness</td></tr>
</table>

What do we do with these people? How can we communicate with them better?
