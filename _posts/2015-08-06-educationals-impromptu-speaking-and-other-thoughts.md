Starting a new speaking club means redoing educationals. Since the club itself is a corporate club meaning there would be limited time to accomplish prepared speeches and limited experience to complete roles like evaluators. 

The first educational was done on impromptu speaking. I focused on the key idea that building public speaking skills revolves around not only increasing our confidence, but also "faking" our confidence. The key idea behind starting table topics are three simple points:

1.  Remember to pause. Pausing is the best way to hide any filler words we might have. It also helps to buy more time which further creates the illusion of confidence.  
2.  Tell/spin the topic to a personal story. One effective way of building rapport with your audience is to tell a personal story. It also helps break up the flow within your speech and makes it easy to perform well in impromptu speaking segment.  
3.  Give it a go! Practise makes perfect. 

The educational was rather impromptu, since I know time would be limited going forward for this. The learning from this was to keep things simple. It is important to do one thing at a time and do that one thing well.
