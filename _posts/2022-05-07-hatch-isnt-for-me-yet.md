title: Hatch isn't for me yet - but Poetry isn't perfect either
---

One of the most curious things is seeing pypa endorsement of a new packaging system in Python, a tool called `hatch`. `hatch` is really interesting in that is overlaps heavily with Poetry but adheres much more strictly to PEP standards (rather than Poetry sometimes outright ignoring it!).

Now my initial impressions of Hatch was that it would introduct much, much more additional complexity over `pipenv` and `poetry` - there are more options, more configuration and more boilerplate. One of the other challenges, were that the defaults didn't seem to just allow me to "get stuff done", instead I found myself trying to learn the ecosystem to figure out what is the appropriate command or workflow that hatch expects. This isn't necessarily a _bad_ thing, I just hoped that it would easily work out of the box.

Based on this I will stick with Poetry for now. I'm hopefully that `hatch`, with a bit more maturity is something I would push for and hope solves many of Python's packaging challenges with ease, particularly to do with monorepos.
