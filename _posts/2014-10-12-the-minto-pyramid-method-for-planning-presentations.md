Roughly a month ago I was introduced to the Minto pyramid principle for planning presentations. In this post I will show you what it is, not really distilling whether I personally like it, but rather just treating it as an additional tool to assist you with planning presentations.

Structure
=========

Whether you're presenting or writing, there is a general structure that we follow. It always is (with some variations) like this:

1. Introduction
2. Body
3. Conclusion

Or if we like to expand it a little bit.

1. Introduction
   1.  Have an engaging opening
   2.  Lead into body of the speech/topic (provide an agenda)
2. Body
   1. Main point(s)
   2. Sub point(s)
3. Conclusion
   1. Review/Summary
   2. Call to action

But in terms of actually _planning_ a speech, where should we start? The Minto pyramid can be applied to answer this very question.

Minto Pyramid Principle
=======================

_Disclaimer: I have **not** read the specific Minto Pyramid book, and am only relying on notes that I have found on the internet._

The key structure when planning is the following:

1.  What is the key message? (My conclusion)
2.  What questions will my readers/listeners have? (Raise them in the introduction/agenda)
3.  What is the key message in my main point (i.e. go back to 1), what questions will my audience have (and address them) etc; develop your argument!

This is an extremely simplistic view of the Minto Pyramid method, but nevertheless highlights many of the main features of this approach. 

An Example
----------

As an illustration, assume we have the following report/presentation on my next car. The report could simply be:

> Electric Cars are wonderful because:  
> 1.  They are better for the environment.  
> 2.  They save money on maintenance cost.  
> 3.  They look futuristic.  

In the format:

*  Question: What is your next car?
*  Answer: Electric Car
*  Question: Why?
*  Answer: Reason 1, 2, 3

In doing so the aim is that presentations are hopefully more engaging and relevant to the listener, as though they themselves are actually part of a conversation; not a monologue.
