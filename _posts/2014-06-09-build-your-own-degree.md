With the increase in the popularity of MOOCs why not try to build your own degree! The easiest
way is to consider some guidelines while copying a sample course outline in university.

Course distribution guidelines (for bachelor degree):

- 2/3 of time dedicated to your major
- 1/3 of time dedicated to general education (subjects not belonging to your school)
- 500 hours of study per semester (full-time) or 250 hours (part-time), or 3000 hours per degree
  - This is roughly 4 courses with 10-15 hours of work / week

The best way (with course information) would be to make use of [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mit-curriculum-guide/) curriculum.

Gleaning the computer science requirements from MIT and many other universities, the degree is generally structured as:

## Core:

- Programming (flow and logic control)
- Programming (object orientated)
- Computer Systems
- Computation Structures
- Software Engineering
- Algorithms
- Artificial Intelligence

## Mathematics:

- Calculus
- Statistics
- Linear Algebra
- Differential Equations

## Electives:

- _various_

As of today, the courses which I need to do to complete a computer science "minor" are software engineering and computer system courses. Both of these would be solved when I take MIT's XSeries courses for

- Software Construction
- Computation Structures
