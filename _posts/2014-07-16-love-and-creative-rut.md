Lately I feel as though I have been stuck in a creative rut. Perhaps it is a winter thing, where it doesn't feel like there is any energy to do something exciting. I tried picking up various game frameworks to give a hand at making a simple game. Above is my version of breakout written in [Lua](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)>) using the [LOVE](http://love2d.org/) framework.

It has provided me with simple abstraction to create a simple game. I tried my hand with [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html), and had a quick look at [cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/). Ultimately I chose LOVE for its simplicity and opportunity to experience a new programming language.

Hopefully in the future I can keep building small simple games. The most advance game I think I could possibly build is something similar to [advance wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars), but I'm a long way from that.

I think the next steps for game development would be (in no particular order):

- [Pac-Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) or [Mazing Contest](http://www.epicwar.com/maps/84365/): for learning about simple AI
- [Concentration](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)>): to learn about mouse interactions
- [Tetris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) : Understand puzzle game, and hopefully start introducing graphical assets into the game.
- A simple side scrolling platform game.

For my notes on how I constructed the game see [refresh-love](http://chappers.github.com/refresh-love).
