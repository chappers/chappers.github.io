I've been playing around with angular as part of my Health of Informatics at Georgia Tech and as part of an experiment I decided to try to write and "deploy" an app using only github pages. You can see [my attempt here](https://github.com/chappers/shuffle-topics).

The restrictions in this scenario was that I chose not to "preview" or "check" any changes actually worked before pushing to the repository, so here you can see all the changes which I made and all the history of what I was doing. This was an interesting experiment because it forced me to consider and think about everything I was doing.
