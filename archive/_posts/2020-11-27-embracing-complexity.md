When we think about green field projects - are they really "green fields" where anything goes? Often in large corporation, green field projects masquerade the actual problem at hand, through demonstrating a desire to over-simplify the problem space. Regardless of the issue, it generally demonstrates many challenges at hand, including Conway's law, the problems with rewriting, and many others.

Here we explore this from a human-centred design perspective, and second-order thinking. Instead what we should be doing is to embrace complexity in the face of confusion. If we understand and are no longer confused then we can tread carefully to resolve the issue.

Its worth noting that simplifying may not necessarily be the correct solution, nor are patterns and standards! We can see this in the real world: there are often competing standards which can interact in perfect harmony:

- Imperial vs Metric systems of measurement
- Different keyboard layouts (QWERTY and DVORAK)
- Different countries having different road rules (including which side of the road you drive on!)

Sometimes its worth reflecting on how we harmoniously operate in the world, and how we can switch from one standard to the other; where is it hard? where is it easy? This might teach us how to resolve conflicts in differing viewpoints and perhaps being "okay" with the notion that some standards won't go on indefinitely, but will eventually be replaced or have competing standards.

Lastly, when considering complexity, and the desire to simplify its also worth remembering that sometimes complexity is designed into the system. In the real-world this manifests in:

- heavy fire doors
- medicine bottles
- critical processes

Its often important to think about how some of these complexities may hide or abstract away critical components - maybe you didn't understand the complexity because someone purposely abstracted it away from you! They didn't want you to play in that space anyway.
