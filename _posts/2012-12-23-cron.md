I have found a useful [cron-like script](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pycron/) for windows using python. Although it is relatively old (last update being in 2011) it still works really well. 

I have applied some changes below to extend its functionality to allow you to put "dash" between numbers. e.g.  

> 1-5  
> 0-59  

and so on, so that it is even more cron-like.

Changes are as follows:  

	def listing(expr):
		listing = [dash(x) for x in string.split(expr,',')]
		return [item for sublist in listing for item in sublist]

	def dash(expr):
		value = [int(x) for x in string.split(expr,'-')]
		return range(min(value),max(value)+1)

	def match(value, expr):

		if expr == '*':
			return 1
		values = listing(expr)

		#user edit to account for dashes
		for v in values:
			if v == value:
				#here for if there are no dashes
				return 1
		return 0
