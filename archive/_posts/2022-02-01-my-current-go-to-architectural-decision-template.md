> ... (a) pattern is a three-part rule, which express a relation between a certain context, a problem, and a solution. - Christopher Alexander 1979

For a while now, I've been using the [Alexandrian Pattern method for architectural decision making](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-for-alexandrian-pattern/index.md), as I believe it has been the most practical and outcomes orientated approach for making business decisions.

To break it down, the Alexandrian way of [thinking consists of three parts](https://tameflow.com/bibliography/#ALEXANDER-1979):

- Context
- Problem
- Solution

This encapsulates a "record" for why something was done, and what was the expected outcome. Typically in the technological sphere this would include:

- Does the solution at hand align with future long-term roadmaps? If not, what was the driving force behind enabling tactical approaches?
- Provides business context and outcomes to why something is attempted in the first place. Sometimes there is lots of activity without much progress - this helps separate those concerns out and helps articulate the problem at hand (often asking the right question is as important as the solution!)
- Enables record keeping so lessons can be learnt in retrospect. Good decisions are sometimes made by accident, and bad decisions are sometimes made with the best intentions. Having a decision record enables a blame-free environment for all stakeholders to discuss and articulate how we can do better.

I'll certainly push more and more for greater record keeping in this fashion and see how it pans out!
