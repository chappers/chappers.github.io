There is a current trend, where company values are "creativity", "innovation". But how do we encourage these
things?

## Learning to Fail

> **Creativity** : the use of imagination or original ideas to create something; inventiveness. -- Google

(Side note, using the word "create" as a definition of "creativity" is probably poor form...since if you didn't know
the definition of creativity, you probably don't know the definition of create!)

You can't be creative, without creating. There is a (very rational) fear when it comes to creating new, unseen, untested
things. We fear ridicule, reputation and ultimately _failure_.

There is no easy way to create new things. Often times the only way is to fail fast, fail hard.

For myself, how many times do you wish:

> I should have asked that question.  
> I should have stood up for myself.  
> I should share my opinion.

These are common thoughts in meetings, in engagements within the workforce.

> "You wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do." -- Eleanor Roosevelt

Indeed, most of the best ideas and implementations of webtools, and software within the company has come from
experimenting, and iterating over several (including some useless) solutions. Infact, one of my
more successful tools at Westpac, was initially ignored, until people understood the intent.

I suppose all this has to do with one thing; theory versus practise. Without failing, how can you possible implement
things into practise?

## Do Less

> (Be) so good that they can't ignore you. -- Steven Martin

You can't possibly create something without thorough knowledge. You must aim to be a master craftsmen in your
domain. After all, the important thing isn't how the _quantity_ of things you do, but rather the _quality_ is
what will be memorable.

Due to this, you should aim to practise the small subset of skills relevant to you; rather than trying to achieve
everything in the sun.

Straight after leaving university here a list of things I tried to do:

- Football
- Rockclimbing
- Powerlifting
- CFA
- Post-graduate Studies
- Learn more programming
- Revisit Music

What was the end result? I achieved proficiency in none of those things and did them all poorly
or have been since abandoned.

Now? I will focus on a smaller and tighter routine. My fitness routine is simplier, concentrating
more on doing what I feel like, and occasionally lifting heavy weights. Sport is seen more
as an opportunity to get me off the computer and socialise with others, whilst my academic pursuits
are placed merely on what would like to master; computer science. If anything I believe that
through targeted practise I have become better at what I want to do and achieve. I suppose
time will tell.

## Constraints

Constraints drive creativity. Toastmasters "Table Topics" is a fortnightly reminder for me about that.
What better way is there to drive innovation that to throw a question at you with no preparation with
the expectation that you will stand there for a full minute and talk.

Of course constraints can also constrict creative processes; when you lack tools or methods which are
familiar to you. But these can also be opportunities to embrace the unknown and attempt to
find other different methods to tackle a challenge.

What has this got to do with creativity? That sometimes the best way to develop and thing up new ideas
is through having a challenge to solve in the first place. Embrace them and challenge presupposed
rules, processes and assumptions.

Finally, create!
