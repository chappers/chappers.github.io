# Machine Learning Engineering

* Who
* What
* Why

---

## Machine Learning Engineer

* A data scientist who does machine learning?
* An engineer who deploys models?
* An data scientist or engineer who trains models?
* A developer who designs machine learning systems?

---

## Do I need a Machine Learning Engineer?

* Machine learning engineer is a multiplier
* Machine learning engineer provides discipline to "data science"

Let's look at the different types of Machine Learning Engineers and 

---

## A Data Scientists who does Machine Learning

Team structure has machine learning engineers perform end-to-end data science, including exploratory analysis, model training, and model deployment. 

* Suited for organisations with lower head count
* Values experimentation and speed over robustness (get things done!)
* Best when there are separate teams to manage platforms and infrastructure

---

## Engineer who handles Machine Learning Operations

Another common pattern is the usage of machine learning engineers for model management, including training, scoring, model management and monitoring. 

* Suited for organisations which have a strong cloud architectural backbone
* Can be used as a mechanism to scale out model management solutions and management
* Requires organisational structures which enable separation between the role of data scientists who provide analysis and machine learning engineers who take the models and place them in production

## Engineer who handles Machine Learning Systems

Another category is machine learning engineers who might be labelled as "machine learning platform engineers". These are engineers involved in the pointy end of deployments, often directly involved in live customer facing deployments and applications

* Suited for organisations where machine learning is a key component to their product
* Allows data-oriented ownership in production deployments
* Requires organisational structures that have a key focus on production and end-to-end ownership
