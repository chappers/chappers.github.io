I've just finished my first web app on Openshift using the `web.py` format!

This will be a list of random thoughts and ideas where I will record them. I like to think of this as my Moleskin notebook which people carry around.

There are still various improvements which I can make:  

*	Adding a framework. Boostrap seems to be skeleton's big brother, so it would be a good starting to point to apply it to this website

Responsive web is not the main goal, though for learning purposes; why not! I suppose the wordcloud could be held static in case you need to zoom...
