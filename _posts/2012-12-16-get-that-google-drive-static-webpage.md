[My weekend project](https://googledrive.com/host/0ByHWFFfBDxCFZ1ctMk9MRjBXc0U/)!

Recently I've been on [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) learning `jQuery` and javascript.

So as an exercise I've made a simple website which tries to get the webpage from your googledrive account based on this blog post.

The way it tries to get the website is using regex on your google drive URL `/\/(\w{13,})\//`.

No error checking was done to ensure that a valid URL was placed in any of the fields.
