How much can we get away with? Is it possible to program and develop on a 10 year old laptop running windows?

This is my attempt at such a setup. Some notes:

- Visual Code Studio is virtually unusable
- Its difficult to have multiple browsers and tab open

Attempt at tooling:
- I'm going to concentrate on leveling up my Golang skills
- I'll use [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) for working in the console, with [micro editor](https://micro-editor.github.io/) as my "IDE" of choice

I think this is the ideal setup as I can stay in the same place (more shortcuts!) and work with the code rather than switching away. I think this should be sufficient for a older computer. Also **not** working in resource intensive setups like Rust, Python, JavaScript should also mean there is minimal friction in the developer's workflow. 

Part of me wishes such biases were in-built, however in the modern world there is little patience for elegance, but rather throwing hardware/compute at it is generally acceptable.
