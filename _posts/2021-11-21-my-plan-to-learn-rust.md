This is probably my ill-conceived plan to learn rust:

1.  Follow the Rust book
2.  When I get bored implement simple games via WASM-4

The games I plan on implementing are from "Code the Classics", which should provide the correct ramp-up in difficulty over time. As a bonus, I do want to have a way to expose the game states for Reinforcement Learning, but I might give up on that thought process as I'm finishing up my PhD. 

<!-- Some thoughts here on trajectory based with GRUs, and just previous state as per DQN - and the complexity
of controlling/comparing the two from a benchmark perspective -->

Let's see how far I get.
