Now that I've crossed the 9 year mark in my working career, I think it is wise to reflect on the last 9 years, and think about what will happen in this space in the next decade.

**Looking Back**

When I first started working, data science was not a formal discipline; there weren't "data science" degrees, and many roles, libraries, and practises simply didn't exist. Infact my very first role was still heavily invested in SAS, and Python was still in its infancy.

As such, I do believe that looking forward, as the space matures, we will continue to see an evolution in the roles as deployments and practises become more complex (by necessity).

**Looking forward**

At the time of writing, Gartner did put forward their view of what a successful AI team would look like. Whilst perhaps 5 years ago, it was expected that a "data scientist" could successfully build things "end-to-end", the view now is that the complexity is too large for a single individual to understand.

Let's break down what Gartner thinks is the future roles for the data science and AI space and their corresponding responsibilities

- Data engineer: reponsible for the servicing of data to systems, namely the classical ETL workflows
- Data scientist: responsible for the consulting (such as identification of use cases), insights and experiments in the analytics lifecycle
- Machine Learning Engineer: responsible for the deployment of models, with concerns around automation, measurement, feedback, and leakage which is present in models
- AI Architect: responsible for the patterns and operations as part of integrating data science within an organisation

**What about the now?**

As I look forward to the next ten years, I do have a more conscious thought process on where _I_ personally want to move towards. Part of it is preparing organisations for the eventual future, and ensure that organisations have the correct discipline and capabilities moving forward.

More and more the space will need to evolve and adapt, we have to think about how we can be the catalyst for that change, beyond pushing for usecases and proof-of-concepts.

_Alternative Take_

One of my personal goals is to "lead and create the AI architecture function", and to "formulise machine learning engineering as a discipline (distinct from data science)"
