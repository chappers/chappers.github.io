This year I'm not making any resolutions.

I'm just going to do what I enjoy and what I want and go from there. Since working full time
(only been working for 2 years or so) I've been doing too much. Been spread too thin.

This year is the year of doing less, but at the same time, doing more. Do less "things"
but doing them in higher standard of quality.

I suppose the immediate change is the change in web design. Undoubtedly influenced by
[mnmlist.com](http://mnmlist.com/goals), yet this perhaps encapsulates what and who
I want to be. Focused on the simple things, and on content rather than flashy stuff.

Of course, website will change in the future (I'm still entertaining the idea of placing
a footer at the bottom). I have left out several pages which I may restore in the future;
but we'll see what happens.
