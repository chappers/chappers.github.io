After not using notebooks for several years, I decided to revisit them, and my conclusion is:

> Don't use notebooks

Even though notebooks are fast becoming the _de facto_ standard for how people interact and explore data in the data science community, I'm not convinced that it is suitable for building appropriate habits.

The data science workflow (like [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining)) is a non-linear lifecycle. However, notebooks (and also academic papers) seem to demonstrate that this isn't the case.

What is worse is productionising workflows using notebooks instead of scripts! This merely exacerbates the issue, and perhaps makes budding data scientists feel that if they don't have the perfect notebook, they're doing something wrong.

Having notebooks also orientes analysis to be more _process_ driven rather than _hypothesis_ driven. For me its not real science - its just ticking the boxes.

**What's the solution?**

The solution should be:

- Encourage data scientists to write reports rather than present notebooks
- Encourage better first principle problem solving: what is the problem? What are the potential solutions? What hypothesis do we have? How do I demonstrate or disprove hypothesis?

This is as important as assuming you have a linear "best way" encoded in a notebook. Notebooks obfuscate the process, and the journey of arriving at the best model, or understanding transformations which are being made is then lost.
